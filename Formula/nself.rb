  # Install the nself binary into the bin directory.
  # Purpose: Extract and place the pre-built CLI binary into the standard Homebrew installation path.
  # Inputs: bin (Homebrew-provided bin installation directory)
  # Outputs: nself binary available in PATH
  # Constraints: The tarball must contain a top-level 'nself' executable; if not, installation fails.

  # Run post-install verification tests for the nself binary.
  # Purpose: Verify that the installed binary is executable and responds to basic commands.
  # Inputs: bin/nself from install phase
  # Outputs: Exit 0 if all tests pass; non-zero if any test fails
  # Constraints: docker and docker-compose dependencies must be available on the system.
  #              Tests do not verify docker functionality, only nself CLI responsiveness.
